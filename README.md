#CS CHAT TRANSLATOR

##What is this?
Are you tired of not being able to read the chat when it's in a different language? Behold!
I present you the CS Chat Translator - it translates any message in the chat in any language to English. 

##How ddo I use it?!
First, launch CS with -condebug to create the console.log file. 
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, since the program uses the file to read the chat.
Then, launch the program, launch CS and enjoy not being left out anymore!
